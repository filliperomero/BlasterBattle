## About The Project

[![Game ScreenShot][game-screenshot]](https://github.com/filliperomero/BlasterBattle)

This project was developed in a Course where we created a Multiplayer Shooter Game with a variety of weapons like Assault Rifles, Pistol, Grenade Launcher, Shotgun, Sniper and some others to choose from. We also implemented a variety of power ups to pickup in the middle of the game to make it more dynamic and fun.

This game have a few game modes developed such as Free-For-All, Capture the Flag and Team Battle.

We implemented our own Plugin so we can connect other players to our session using Steam or other online service since we make use of the Unreal Engine Online Subsystem which can be used for other services.

Taking Multiplayer in account, we had to implement techniques to compensate for lag. Some of the techniques used were Client Side Prediction and Server-Side Rewind, which gave us the ability to balance the game and made it fair even if a player has a high ping.
